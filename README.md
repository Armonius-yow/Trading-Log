## Context
After trading in the futures market for several months and developing my understanding of price action, I realized that I still haven't found any objective method to measure my skill in trading. I remembered that I can use python for this and this became a project to test myself on. I used this in tandem with trading and started visualizing with boxplots, bar charts and scatter plots on my gross P/L, roi and strategy column as well as date/time. I also quantified different aspects such as win rate, and win factor to gauge if my skill as a trader is getting better.
## Shortcomings
There are many ways I can make this better, for starters, I can
* Create functions for the main activities like creating columns and a direct calculation of my win rate and win factor
* Introduce some other calculations that tries to understnad the average ROI and look at the trades that produce a higher ROI
I need to add more of the visualization that I did here. but this is the notebook i created when i was using the top step account.. I had created numerous trading log notebooks for my prop firm account,, my personal account and the simulation account.
I am also going to upload the csv files of my trades to Google drive and post here at some point 
## What's going on now
I have also taken a break in trading so I dont necessarily add new data to this every day like I used to. That is because I realized that there is another area I am severely lacking in and that is the quantitative aspect of analyzing financial markets. I have tkaen a break in actual experimentation with the markets so I can develop my quantitative research skill by utilizing data from the futures indices to give me information to help me take better trades. I'm working on another project to inform my Trend Following Trades with what is more probable and what isn't
